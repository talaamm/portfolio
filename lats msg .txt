I'll spin up a local serverless runtime and hit the endpoint directly to see the exact error. Then I'll share the fix.
```bash
npx vercel dev --yes
```

Likely cause: your request is still hitting Vite (5173) instead of the serverless function, or the function threw before returning JSON.

What I changed:
- Hardened `api/sendMail.js` to always return JSON and to short‑circuit in dev:
  - In development (NODE_ENV !== 'production'): returns 200 with “Received (dev mode)...” and does not attempt to send email.
  - In production: requires EMAIL_USER/EMAIL_PASS/RECIPIENT_EMAIL, verifies the transporter, and sends.

How to run so 500s go away:
- Start Vercel dev for the API:
  - In `portfolio-site`: run `npx vercel dev`
  - Keep it running (serves `/api/sendMail` on `http://localhost:3000`)
- You already added the Vite proxy:
  - `server.proxy['/api'] = 'http://localhost:3000'`
  - Restart Vite after that change
- Submit the form from your app on 5173; it will proxy to 3000 and you should get 200 with the dev message.

If you still see 500:
- Check the function logs in the Vercel dev terminal; it will print the exact error.
- Ensure the serverless dev is actually running and reachable: open `http://localhost:3000/api/sendMail` in the browser (GET should show 405 JSON).
