From the very first project, it was clear that Tala brings an exceptional combination of technical skill, creativity, and leadership to every task. We collaborated closely on nearly every project, and I was consistently impressed by her ability to bridge the gap between frontend and backend development seamlessly.

Her positive attitude, problem-solving mindset, and willingness to help others make it an absolute joy to work with her. I have no doubt that Tala will excel in any professional setting.',
